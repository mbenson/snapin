/**
 * Annotation to trigger processing of a {@link SnapinTemplate} and define a
 * snap-in. This is an abstract class defining template methods that should be
 * given the opportunity to make calls against a "snapped in" implementation of
 * a given interface as though the methods called belonged to the snap-in
 * itself. A good way to think of this pattern is as a structure for managing a
 * temporary mixin.
 *
 * The hosting template should be {@code abstract}; it is further considered a
 * best practice to define the template with package-scope access.
 * 
 * The generated snap-in class will be {@code public abstract} and will live in
 * the same package as the hosting class. It will clone any type parameters from
 * the template, and implement the interface specified by {@link SnapinTemplate}
 * type parameter {@code T}, forwarding all calls to a {@code private} variable
 * {@code snapin} of the interface type.
 *
 * For every {@code protected abstract} (template) method defined on the hosting
 * class, a package-access {@code final synchronized} method will be defined
 * prepending an argument of the interface type which will invoke the template
 * method using the first argument as the snap-in. These methods may then be
 * invoked as desired.
